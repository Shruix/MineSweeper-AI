# MineSweeper-AI
Primitive Minesweeper created in unity using C#. Bundled with an AI for said MineSweeper

This project came about from my interest in AI and learning how to make AI. I wasnt really sure where
I wanted to start with learning so I decided to start with something that would be relatively easy.

Q: Could you not have just done this with a screen reading Python program?
Yes, I could have done it this way, since literally everyone has done this before and it seems to be the simplist way
considering the goal is to create an AI and not a minesweeper game. But alas, I am a game developer and so why not
just recreate the whole thing myself???

Yes I'm aware this isnt the logical choice nor the smartest or easiest choice but heck. Why not. I'm sick of the 'easy way'
